# ft_printf

## Description

This is a reimplementation of the `printf` function.
The function seeks to simplify the printing of different types, such as numbers, pointers, etc...

## Instructions

To build the project, use the Makefile :

```
make all
```
This command will build the current project with the libft folder and output a `libftprintf.a` library that can then be included in a project using gcc.

## Resources

I didn't use AI in this project, I used resources like geeksforgeeks or W3School to learn about the va_arguments.
StackOverflow to debug problems I encountered.
